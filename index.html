          <strong>Green Island</strong>, also known as Lyudao or Ludao, is a small island located
          off the east coast of Taiwan. Although it covers only 15 km<sup>2</sup>—definitely smaller
          than Toronto—travelers can enjoy a perfect getaway, whether they prefer exploring
          spectacular beaches or swimming alongside turtles and fish. Let's dive deep and explore
          more of Green Island, a true paradise in Taiwan!

          <strong>Green Island</strong> is a fantastic place for diving! Do you want to swim with
          sea turtles and discover the world beneath the sea? This is the perfect choice! The
          world's largest small-pore coral formation attracts bannerfish, sea stars, and puffers.
          When you dive into this hidden underwater world, you can imagine yourself swimming like
          Nemo, gliding through the gorgeous coral palaces and playing with sea creatures.
        </p>

        <p>
          Many people, including myself, earned their first scuba diving certification here. After
          five days of training, you can dive down to 18 meters and explore famous dive sites like
          <strong>Big Mushroom</strong> and <strong>Church</strong>. If you obtain an advanced
          diving certification, <strong>Dabaisha</strong>, <strong>Steel Reef</strong>,
          <strong>Chicken Reef</strong>, and <strong>Grand Canyon</strong> are waiting for you.
        </p>

        <p>
          Traveling to a <strong>secluded island</strong> offers a peaceful escape from the hustle
          and bustle of city life. Diving into the sea takes that tranquility to another level. You
          will focus on your own breath, the sounds created by sea creatures, and the smooth water
          flow as it moves around your body.

          There are many beaches on Green Island. Dabaisha has the largest
          <strong>white sand beach</strong> on the island. Here, a long narrow bridge extends into
          the sea and gets submerged during <strong>high tide</strong>, allowing travelers to take
          stunning photos that make it look like they are standing on the water's surface.
        </p>

        <p>
          You can also find some spectacular coastal rock formations.
          <strong>Sleeping Beauty Rock</strong> and <strong>Pug Dog Rock</strong> await you at
          <strong>Haicanping</strong>. Around <strong>Niutou Hill</strong>,
          <strong>Guanyin Cave</strong> is a notable sea cave in the area, and you can even take a

          Green Island is home to the most famous prison in Taiwan, which is well known for
          detaining
          <strong>political prisoners</strong> during the <strong>White Terror</strong> period. The
          White Terror was a historical period that began with the
          <strong>228 Incident on February 28, 1947,</strong> and lasted for the next 38 years. More
          than 140,000 Taiwanese were accused of opposing the Kuomintang (KMT), suspected of
          communism, or alleged to be Chinese communist spies. Around 20,000 prisoners were
          incarcerated in <strong>Green Island Prison</strong>, and some of them never left.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Shih Ming-teh</strong> was a prominent political prisoner during the White Terror.
          He was sentenced to life imprisonment twice, in 1962 and 1980. As a key leader of the
          opposition party <strong>Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)</strong>, he played a
          significant role in promoting <strong>democracy</strong>, <strong>freedom</strong>, and
          <strong>civil rights</strong> in Taiwan during that period. Today, the
          <strong>Green Island White Terror Memorial Park</strong> serves as a reminder of this dark
          chapter in history, hoping that such events will never happen again anywhere in the world.
